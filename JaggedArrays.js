/**
 * Problem - Jagged Arrays
 * Note - A jagged array is an array where the rows in the array may have a different number of elements. Many prgramming languages have problem in handling jagged arrays , but Js does not
 *        since we can compute the length of any row. Ex. - Solved in the grades array.
